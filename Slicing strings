#note: The syntax of slicing is you have to initiate the start position value and end position value with colon in square brackets
#slice to the start 
a="happy world"
print(a[0:2])
#by leaving out starting index ,the character starts from the first letter of a string 
a="happy world"
print(a[:6]
#slice to the end 
A="happy world"
print(A[0:])
#output: happy world
